\chapter{Introduction}

The advance in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) proposes a new method for reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images.

By leveraging NeRFs we can create a pipeline that efficiently reconstructs 3D scenes. The reconstructed scenes have many applications, and could be beneficial in applications that require simulated virtual worlds.

This thesis explores how we can leverage NeRFs to reconstruct realistic 3D scenes from 2D images. Further it will explore the limits of NeRFs and see how the capacity can affect how large scenes can be reconstructed.

% and modify an open-source large-scale NeRF pipeline to create a virtual environment of parts of Trondheim.
